# Project Template

When creating a project, we can include a template to pre-populate it with models and jobs. Project template can be defined with a yaml file.

By convention, the name of the yaml file can be used as the value of `--template` option when creating a project. For example, if you create a project with this command: `project create --name MyProject --template sample`, the system will try to find `sample.yaml` file in `[base]\Templates\` folder.

The following things can be put as the content of the yaml file:
```yaml
client: [client of the project]
models:
  - name: [name of the model]
    label: [label of the model]
    properties:
      - name: [name of the model property]
        label: [label of the model property]
        data-type: [string | int | short | float | double | decimal | bool | datetime | byte | guid | dbgeography]
        control-type: [input-text | input-number | input-file | textarea | checkbox | checkboxlist | select | radio | calendar | image]
        is-required: [true | false]
jobs:
  - name: [name of the job]
    tasks:
      - name: [name of the job task]
        type: [Build | Clone | Deploy | DeployDb | Generate | Merge | Push | PublishArtifact | Test]
        provider: [name of the provider plugin]
        configs:
          [any additional configs which are required by the provider, e.g:]
          GitHubExternalService: [name of the GitHub external service]
          AzureAppAppServiceExternalService: [name of the AzureAppService external service]
          CreatePullRequest: [true | false]
```

The yaml file can also be generated by exporting the existing project.
