# Manage job definitions

Job definitions contain jobs that can be [queued](job-queues.md) to [engine](engine-registration.md). Each job definition would contains a list of task that the engine would need to execute.

## Add job definition

Add new job definition by specifying the project name and the new job definition name
```sh
dotnet occli.dll job add --project MyProject --name Default
```

All of the created job for a project can be viewed using the `list` command:
```sh
dotnet occli.dll job list --project MyProject
```

## Remove job definition

Remove job definition by specifying the project name and the job definition name to be removed
```sh
dotnet occli.dll job remove --project MyProject --name Default
```

## Add job task

Add a task to a job definition by specifying the project name, job definition name, and the name of the new task. You can also specify the task properties that would be used in the task's service provider
```sh
dotnet occli.dll task add --project MyProject --job Default --name generate --type Generate --provider AspNetCoreMvc
```

Each job task type will have specific [configurations](#job-task-types) that will be prompted for input. You can leave them blank if it's not required. [Generic configurations](#generic-task-configurations) will not be prompted for input. Instead, you can set them using the `--property` option, and specify the configuration names and their values, separated by `:`. For example this will set the `ContinueWhenError` configuration:
```sh
dotnet occli.dll task add --project MyProject --job Default --name generate --type Generate --provider AspNetCoreMvc --property ContinueWhenError:true
```

All of the created task for a job definition can be viewed using the `list` command:
```sh
dotnet occli.dll task list --project MyProject --job Default
```

## Update job task

You can update a task by specifying the project name, job definition name, and the name of the task to be updated. Then you can specify the other options to be updated:
```sh
dotnet occli.dll task update --project MyProject --job Default --name generate --rename generator
```

To update the task [configurations](#job-task-types), you can use the `--property` option, and specify the configuration names and their values, separated by `:`. For example this will set the `OutputLocation` configuration of the `Generate` task:
```sh
dotnet occli.dll task update --project MyProject --job Default --name generate --property OutputLocation:C:\GeneratedCode
```

## Remove job task

Remove a task by specifying the project name, the job definition name, and the task name to be removed
```sh
dotnet occli.dll task remove --project MyProject --job Default --name generate
```

## Job task types

Each job task type have a specific function, and its own configurations.
